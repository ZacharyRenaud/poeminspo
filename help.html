        <h2>Come up with a Title</h2>
        <p>Crafting an evocative and compelling title for a poem can serve as a catalyst for the entire creative process. The act of brainstorming and settling on the perfect title triggers a series of associations, imagery, and themes within the poet's mind. It provides a focal point, a guiding star that sets the tone and direction for the poem. A well-crafted title captures the essence of the poetic expression and encapsulates the core message or emotion that the poet wishes to convey. It helps establish a framework for the poem, shaping its structure, imagery, and overall flow. Furthermore, a thoughtful title can inspire curiosity, intrigue, and anticipation within both the poet and the reader, fueling the desire to explore and delve deeper into the realms of language and emotions. By devoting time and attention to developing an impactful title, poets can unlock their creativity, tap into the depths of their imagination, and embark on a poetic journey filled with purpose and clarity.</p>

        <h2>Pick a Theme!</h2>
        <p>Developing a clear and resonant theme serves as a powerful anchor in the process of writing a poem. The theme acts as the underlying thread that weaves together the various elements of the poem, lending it coherence, depth, and meaning. When poets establish a theme, they establish a conceptual framework that guides their creative decisions and shapes the overall direction of the poem. It provides a unifying concept or idea that allows for exploration and development within the verses. By delving into a specific theme, poets can delve into its nuances, implications, and associated emotions, enabling a focused exploration of the subject matter. The theme becomes a lens through which the poet can analyze and convey their perspective, inviting readers to engage with the poem on a profound level. It adds layers of richness and significance, transforming the poem into a vessel for contemplation, reflection, and connection. Ultimately, by consciously establishing a theme, poets gain a profound sense of purpose and direction, enabling them to craft poems that resonate deeply with both themselves and their audience.</p>
        
        <h2>Write about anything</h2>
        <p>The boundless freedom of knowing that one can write about anything serves as a liberating force in the realm of poetry. This knowledge opens the floodgates of creativity, allowing poets to explore a vast landscape of ideas, emotions, and experiences. The mere realization that no topic is off-limits or too mundane ignites a sense of curiosity and possibility within the poet's mind. It encourages them to delve into personal narratives, observe the world around them, and engage with a wide range of subjects, both ordinary and extraordinary. This unlimited scope cultivates a sense of fearlessness, inspiring poets to experiment with different styles, perspectives, and forms of expression. It sparks a spirit of discovery, as poets uncover hidden connections, juxtapose unlikely concepts, and breathe life into the mundane through their unique lens. The freedom to write about anything fosters a sense of authenticity and self-expression, empowering poets to embrace their individuality and share their stories and insights with the world. In this boundless realm of poetic exploration, the possibilities are infinite, and the pen becomes an instrument of endless creativity and discovery.</p>
