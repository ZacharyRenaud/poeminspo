<h2>Here's a poem about a purple unicorn making friends:</h2>
        <p>In realms of verse, where magic blends,
            A tale unfolds, where friendship ascends.
    A purple unicorn, enchanting and rare,
Dances through stardust, with grace and flair.

With flowing mane of lavender hue,
This wondrous creature, so pure and true,
Gallops 'neath the moon's gentle gleam,
Dreaming of friendships, like a poet's theme.

Through meadows adorned in floral array,
The unicorn seeks companions on its way,
Whispering secrets to the whispering trees,
And frolicking 'midst the evening breeze.

With shimmering horn, a beacon of light,
It illuminates darkness, banishing the night.
Through valleys deep and mountains high,
Its spirit soars, painting the sky.

And as its hooves tread on the emerald ground,
The unicorn discovers new friends abound.
Creatures of wonder, both big and small,
Answer the call, they hear its poetic call.

A gentle deer, with eyes so kind,
A playful squirrel, quick of mind,
A wise owl, with feathers of gold,
And a tiny butterfly, vibrant and bold.

Together they form a harmonious band,
Their spirits entwined, hand in hand.
With laughter and joy, their hearts intertwine,
A poem of friendship, truly divine.

For in this tale, through verse unfurled,
Lies a lesson, precious and pearl.
That friendships, like poetry's graceful art,
Bring magic and love, forever to impart.

So let our words be bridges that span,
Uniting hearts in a poetic plan,
As the purple unicorn, with friends so dear,
Leads us to a world, where dreams appear.</p>
